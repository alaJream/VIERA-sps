*(Inspired by my blog post)*

Welcome to the Journey of VIERA coming to life. 

This is a single page site about my mental health speaker idea, *the app experience side*.

If you look through you will have a nav bar at the top, that if you click any of the items, it will bring you to the corresponding section of that topic.
Including the Wireframes, features, style, and the email sign up. You will see the "animation on scroll" for each section come into play as I showcase my examples on how I would want everything to look as well as how I would want everything structured. 

Hope you enjoy!

  And we are [live!](https://alajream.github.io/VIERA-sps/)
